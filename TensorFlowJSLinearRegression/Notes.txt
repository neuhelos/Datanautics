Mean Squared Error (MSE) - Loss Function
measures the average of the squares of the errorsâ€”that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. The standard deviation of the residuals (prediction errors). 

Residuals are a measure of how far from the regression line data points are; 
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is a measure of how spread out these residuals are.
